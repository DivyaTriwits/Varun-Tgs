Others have focused on issues such as economic inequality or corporate accountability.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<li>We consider proposals from both freelance and staff journalists in all forms of media â text, audio, and short-form video â and encourage those that combine formats to create a multimedia package.

Think of it as a pitch, much like you would submit to an editor at a newspaper, magazine, audio or digital outlet: give us enough preliminary reporting and documentation to demonstrate that the story is solid. <br><br>\r\n<li>The proposal should highlight whatâs new and significant about the story, why it matters and what its potential impact might be. The proposal should also note where significant stories on the subject have run elsewhere and how the proposed piece would differ. <br><br><li>Applicants should also briefly outline a proposed reporting plan and a timeline for completing the story. And while you donât need to have a media outlet lined up for your story before you apply, if you do have one, let us know that in your proposal.<br><br>\r\n<li>In addition, applicants should enclose three journalism samples. The samples should be professionally published work that showcases your ability to tackle an in-depth story in the proposed medium. Please also provide us with an up-to-date resume.

Technology-driven solutions to local problems at scale, such as healthcare, education, agriculture, finance, sustainability, and so on, are critical for equitable growth.

At the micro level, it has reached Tier 2/3 cities in India, and the population of lower-tier cities is becoming affluent and eager to spend. Indiaâs development has undoubtedly extended beyond the metropolises, owing to government policies, improved infrastructure, improved digital connectivity, shifting consumer attitudes, consumption growth, and increased technology adoption. Technology-driven solutions to local problems at scale, such as healthcare, education, agriculture, finance, sustainability, and so on, are critical for equitable growth. The tech revolution is driven by local talent, indigenous innovations, and aspirational youth in Tier 2 and 3 cities, developing the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<li>To galvanize the start-up community and attract attention, the government has launched a series of initiatives to enable conducive infrastructure, support ecosystems, and increase funding availability. On the 76th anniversary of Indiaâs independence, Honâble Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi stated from Red Fort, âToday we are witnessing the structure of Digital India. Weâre looking into new businesses. Who are these individuals? This pool of talent resides in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and villages and comes from low-income families. These are our youngsters coming before the world today with discoveriesâ.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<li>In this regard, STPI has planned to undertake a new initiative to promote start-ups and entrepreneurship in newer/emerging cities (Tier-II and Tier-III cities) and motivate the youth towards innovation & entrepreneurship in emerging tech/deep tech sector for a vibrant start-up ecosystem in Tier II/III cities. Under this new initiative, STPI plans to do the following in Tier II/III cities across various states:\r\n<br>\r\n1. Conduct various workshops and seminars involving leading IT/Tech companies, their CXOs and other industry leaders.<br>\r\n2.
